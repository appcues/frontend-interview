# appcues-component-library

## Setup

This project uses the Node 8 LTS (currently 8.9.x)

To get developing:

```
npm install
npm start
```

then head over to `localhost:8080`!

If import FontAwesome in your repository's index.html, you will need to update it to include `searchPseudoElements`:

`FontAwesomeConfig = { autoReplaceSvg: 'nest', searchPseudoElements: true }`

## Local Dev

To build the component library for a local application:

```
npm run build:local
```
When prompted, enter the path to the repository you want to install in, eg:

```
../react.appcues.com
```

Note that you will have to rebuild any changes in the component library using this same process.

## Testing

Unit tests use [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) and
[Enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme)

## Deployment

(as of May 24, 2019)
1. `git checkout master`
2. Run `np` in your shell and go through the prompts. We use semver for versioning. If you need to install np, run `npm install --global np`.
3. In the release notes, keep the autogenerated results and add a description of the release above. [Example](https://github.com/appcues/component-library/releases/tag/v1.13.0). Reference every component that is modified.
4. For any repositories that use this library, update the version reference on their package.json

## Linting

This project uses a combination of eslint and prettier.
